# FL_Pop_Map
A population density map of Florida based on Census data, using d3.js for CMPS 165 @ UCSC

Files included:
flPopDensity.html
fl.json
cal.json (explained in bonus points submission area)

Currently displays the population density of California, due to problems with topojson. Once those problems are fixed,
the program will be updated to utilize the correct fl.json. 
Clicking on the tracts button on the bottom will add census tract boundaries and clicking on color shifts the color range
from a warm one to a cool one.
